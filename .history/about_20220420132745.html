        <p>I've had a fascination with programming since as long as I can remember. It initially began with video games.
            I
            have vivid memories of sitting in my basement and playing video games from sun up until sundown for days on
            end,
            always thinking one thing. "Man, I can't wait until I can make one of these myself someday." From a young
            age, I
            knew that video game development was what I wanted to do. </p>
        <p>I started software development with Multimedia Fusion 2 when I was 10, and ever since that day I've been
            steadily
            picking up new languages, new concepts, and new skills. There's such a visceral thrill that I experience
            just by
            learning something new, and nowhere is that feeling stronger than learning a new programming concept. I've
            still
            retained my love for video games in all of its forms, and I would still love to develop one some day, but my
            admiration for programming has extended beyond that. My love for video games has long since evolved into a
            love of
            programming itself. Be it C++ or Java or Python, whether for apps or games or websites... no matter what it
            is, if
            it's programming, I am having a great time.</p>
        <p>Aside from just programming, I have other interests in the STEM field. Throughout much of middle and high
            school,
            I
            participated in numerous FLL, FTC, and BEST robotics competitions,
            <a
                href="https://parkcities.bubblelife.com/community/parish_episcopal_school/library/35669203/key/35752830/Parish_Robotics_Advances_at_FTC_Tournament">some
                of which we won awards at</a>.
            I also aided in designing and building telemetry and task completion systems for the <a
                href="https://sites.google.com/a/parishepiscopal.org/parish-rover-team-2017---2018/">NASA 2018 Rover
                competition.</a>
            I enjoy working both alone and in teams, which grants me a great deal of flexibility in projects. My first
            job
            working at
            <a
                href="https://www.cityofcarrollton.com/departments/departments-g-p/parks-recreation/aquatics/rosemeade-rainforest-3031">Rosemeade
                Rainforest Aquatic Complex</a>
            as a lifeguard helped foster both the confidence to act on my own judgement and the ability to plan and act
            alongside others at a moment's notice in time-sensitive environments. Furthermore, my love of learning
            allows me
            the
            capability to take on projects using skills I don't even possess yet (such as the aforementioned Rover
            competition).
            I pride myself on my versatility in capabilities when it comes to accomplishing a wide variety of tasks.
        </p>
        <p>In terms of hobbies, I enjoy pretty much everything "nerdy". I love video games, especially RPGs and strategy
            games. I additionally collect video game consoles: everything from the Atari 2600 to the Nintendo Switch. I
            play
            Dungeons and Dragons and Starfinder in the enviable position of "forever DM". I frequently play card games,
            notably
            Magic the Gathering, as well as board games. When I can, I enjoy reading the occasionally Sci-Fi/Fantasy
            novel
            (although finding the time to do so gets harder every day.)</p>
