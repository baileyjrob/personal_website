    <p>As part of MAKERplay, I traveled to children's hospitals and helped children build toys with DIY kits. This STEM
      project allowed these children to take their minds off their conditions while stimulating their critical thinking
      and creativity. After two years of this, I took on the additional responsibility of designing a kit of my own. The
      kit involved connecting a Raspberry pi to buttons on a breadboard with LEDs. When the kid pressed one of the
      buttons, the corresponding LED would light up.</p>

    <p> In the future, I would love to be more involved with service, especially in the STEM field. It is always
      wonderful
      to be able to combine my passion for STEM with my desire to help others in a way that's constructive and gives
      back
      to the community.</p>
